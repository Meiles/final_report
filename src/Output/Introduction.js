        At first, I wanted the ability to update your healthcare data in realtime with some kind of external monitor,
        either the Apple iWatch or newer models of fitbit. As I learned more about the different ways to retrieve healthcare data,
        I found that there were many different ways to perform the retrieval of medical data already on the market.

        and many ways that couldn't connect to each other. While looking around, I found the HL7Â® website which pointed me towards
        the FHIR or Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources.
