Later in development it was changed to "FastChart" which reflected it\'s new aim towards front-facing healthcare professionals. This application will be used to download the user\'s FHIR\xae records from supported healthcare institutions. The system then updates the records in the background on a scheduled basis. The user will have to consent to give out clinical data however, test data will be used in preliminary testing. With more updates, the possibility of integrating an iWatch app to compare real-time data pulled from the FHIR records could be used to better track a person\'s state based on their medical history. The application will be primarily developed using the Xcode IDE on the Mac OSX operating system. This application will be an iOS app utilizing the swift programming language as its source. The structure of the presentation will be orally based, with a simulation of the app running to show the application when in use on the iOS framework. I will put together a short video showing a short synopsis of how the app was made as well.'))}),p=function(e){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"introduction",onchange:e.changed},o.a.createElement("p",null,"At first, I wanted the ability to update your healthcare data in realtime with some kind of external monitor, either the Apple iWatch or newer models of fitbit.

I believe that with more research on the functionality given by the HL7\xae FHIR\xae framework, my goal of being able to change EHR data in real-time may actually be able to be accomplished. Perhaps however, this kind of app would be better over a browser especially because of the lightweight nature of applications hosted within browsers. An Apple iWatch coule somehow do the samething, but maybe in 30 minute increments or less depending on the situation, but i'm not sure if external monitors other than truly professional equipment can be lifesaving.
