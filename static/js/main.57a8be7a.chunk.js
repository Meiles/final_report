This application will be used to download the user's FHIR records from supported healthcare institutions. The system then updates the records in the background on a scheduled basis. The user will have to consent to give out clinical data however, test data will be used in preliminary testing. With more updates, the possibility of integrating an iWatch app to compare real-time data pulled from the FHIR records could be used to better track a person's state based on their medical history. The application will be primarily developed using the Xcode IDE on the Mac OSX operating system. This application will be an iOS app utilizing the swift programming language as its source. The structure of the presentation will be orally based, with a simulation of the app running to show the application when in use on the iOS framework. I will put together a short video showing a short synopsis of how the app was made as well."))}),s=a(3),c=a.n(s);a(11);var h=function(){return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},i.a.createElement("header",{className:"App-header"},i.a.createElement("img",{src:c.a,className:"App-logo",alt:"logo"}),i.a.createElement(l,null),i.a.createElement("a",{className:"App-link",href:"https://meiles.github.io/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Back to Hub")))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(i.a.createElement(h,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}],[[4,1,2]]]);
